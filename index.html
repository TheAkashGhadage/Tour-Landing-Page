                <h4>Raigad Fort camp Trek</h4>
                <p> Raigad was known as the mountain of “Rairi” before it was captured by Shivaji Maharaj.
                    Due to its impregnability, Raigad was known as “Gibraltar of East”. 
                    In the 16th century, when this was not developed as a fort, it was called by local people as “Rashivata” and “Tanas”. 
                    Due to its shape of a tall oil lamp tower, it was also called as “Nandadeep”. On 6th April 1656, Shivaji Maharaj besieged 
                    Rairi and captured it in May. The then Subhedar of Kalyan was transporting the treasure of Adilshah to Bijapur,
                    which was raided by Marathas and utilized to fortify Raigad.</p>
